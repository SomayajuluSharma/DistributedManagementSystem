Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of a distributed file system, built as a learning exercise to understand core distributed system concepts such as data chunking, replication, fault tolerance, and secure access. Inspired by how Facebook structures its News Feed by handling data in chunks, this project aims to bring similar principles to file storage and management.

Features

Data Chunking & Partitioning: Splits large files into manageable chunks for efficient storage and retrieval.
Replication & Fault Tolerance: Ensures data is replicated across nodes to maintain reliability.
Efficient Indexing & Metadata Management: Uses MongoDB for fast and flexible file metadata storage.
Object Storage: Integrates MinIO for high-performance file storage.
Caching: Utilizes Redis to cache frequently accessed data, enhancing performance.
Security: Secured with Spring Boot Security for robust authentication and authorization.
Architecture

Describe your architecture here. You might include a diagram or a brief explanation of how the components interact (e.g., client requests → API gateway/controller → file service → storage systems).

Example:

Client Layer: User interface or API client interacting with the system.
Application Layer: Spring Boot services handling file operations.
Data Layer: MongoDB for metadata, MinIO for file storage, and Redis for caching.
Technologies Used

Java & Spring Boot: Core application development.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for metadata management.
MinIO: Object storage service.
Redis: Caching layer to boost performance.
Spring Boot Security: Manages authentication and authorization.
Setup and Installation

Prerequisites
Java 11+
Maven (or your preferred build tool)
MongoDB installed and running
MinIO installed and running
Redis installed and running
Steps
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distributed-file-system.git
cd distributed-file-system
Build the Project:
mvn clean install
Configure Environment:
Update the configuration files (e.g., application.properties or application.yml) with your MongoDB, MinIO, and Redis connection details.
Run the Application:
mvn spring-boot:run
Configuration

Provide a sample configuration for your project. For example, in src/main/resources/application.properties:

# MongoDB configuration
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/distributedfs

# MinIO configuration
minio.url=http://localhost:9000
minio.access-key=yourAccessKey
minio.secret-key=yourSecretKey

# Redis configuration
redis.host=localhost
redis.port=6379

# Security configuration
security.jwt.secret=yourJWTSecret
Usage

Explain how users can interact with your system. For instance:

Uploading a File:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/files/upload -F "file=@/path/to/your/file"
Downloading a File:
curl -O http://localhost:8080/api/files/download/{fileId}
Add more details as needed based on your project's functionalities.

API Endpoints

List and briefly describe your API endpoints:

POST /api/files/upload: Uploads a file to the system.
GET /api/files/{id}: Retrieves metadata for a specific file.
GET /api/files/download/{id}: Downloads a specific file.
DELETE /api/files/{id}: Deletes a file from the system.
